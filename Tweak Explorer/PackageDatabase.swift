        Inspired by the watchOS Motion face, Jellyfish aims to make your Lock screen more modern, more beautiful, and more useful.

        Jellyfish refreshes the Lock screen with a beautiful new design, emphasizing both the time and date. The date takes its colour from your wallpaper, creating a beautiful blended effect, while still retaining its legibility.

        Jellyfish also adds weather to your Lock screen, so you can always view it at a quick glance. While adding this new level of information, your Lock screen retains its simplicity, avoiding a cluttered look.
